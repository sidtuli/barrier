        <h1>Differences, Explained</h1>
        
        <p>As you've seen in each region, there are a variety of differences in the videos of each location, so I will explain. The choppiness of videos and the delay of revealing statistics are tied directly to the average speed of internet in the area. Having a delay on revealing statistics, the amount of video blacked out, and the portion of an ending quote missing all relate to censorship present in the area.Whether or not the narrative goes to the library or bookstore is a reflection of internet infrastructure. I believe internet service is a public good so then if it is widely available, by government policy or public investment, it is affordable to the community, like a library. If the reverse is true then that means that it is expensive to use the internet or it comes at additional burden to the user, like a book store. That is shown with the difference of using money or a library card to access the book at the final exchange. Additionally, the audio of a bus, public transportation, or walking, a lack of public transportation, was again stressing how the internet is a public service that is not properly supported in certain places.</p>
